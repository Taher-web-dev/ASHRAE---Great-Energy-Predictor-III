# Kaggle project  : ASHRAE---Great-Energy-Predictor-III
This is  my first contribution to kaggle competitions. In this competition, We are demanded to develop accurate models of metered building energy usage in the following areas: chilled water, electric, hot water, and steam meters. The data comes from over 1,000 buildings over a three-year timeframe. With better estimates of these energy-saving investments, large scale investors and financial institutions will be more inclined to invest in this area to enable progress in building efficiencies.
