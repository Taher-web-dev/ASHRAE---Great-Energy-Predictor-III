# ASHRAE---Great-Energy-Predictor-III
This is  my first contribution to kaggle competitions. In this competition, We are demanded to develop accurate models of metered building energy usage in the following areas: chilled water, electric, hot water, and steam meters. The data comes from over 1,000 buildings over a three-year timeframe. With better estimates of these energy-saving investments, large scale investors and financial institutions will be more inclined to invest in this area to enable progress in building efficiencies.  
In this repistory, you find the following files:  
Cleaning and data exploration: In this file, we had make the cleaning datas, the data visualisation and some statisticals analyses to explore the data. Besides we had identified the meaningful features to integrate in our modeling step.  
xgbost: In this file  we had fine tuning the xgbost algorhitm, which we had used to predict the energy consumption for the kaggle'submission datas.
